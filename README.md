# stock-analysis
Overview

In this project we analyzed whether refracting the code provided in the Stock Market dataset would result in faster run times using VBA. We analyzed the data and created more efficient code that generated the results in a more concise manner.

Results

From the initial dataset, we created nested if-then statements that helped compile the data but generated the findings for 2017 and 2018 in longer than satisfactory run-times. By focusing on shortening our code, and creating more efficient statements, the findings were much more readily available.

Summary

By refracting the code, we were able to create a report that is readily available to the consumer in a timely manner. The major disadvantage was drilling down into the data to find the gaps that were available for us to shorten our scripting.
